UPDATE 7/18/2021:

- Fixed crash when entering cockpit
- Helmet now opens automatically when you drinking something. Drink responsibly when in outer space!


Have to keep hydrated!


Water stat is added, which will result in serious health issues for the engineer when depleted.

The only way to restore water is to consume Cosmic Coffee or Clang Cola.

Sorry, no healthier options exists in the universe right now!
